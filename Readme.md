# SharpCLABot

![](logo.png)

SharpCLABot is a robot running on the **ASP.net platform** that will help you to:

- **Check Pull Requests** submitted to your github repository. 
- Redirect new contributors to an **online electronic form** to sign the **Contributor License Agreement** of your project.

### Features

- Fully integrated with github. 
- Receive pull-request events, auto-comment on pull-request
- Use github contributor identity via OAuth to verify before signing
- Easy step-by-step configuration online
- Administrator configuration panel
 - Customize templates for the bot comment replies
 - Customize templates for the *Individual CLA* and *Information about Us*  
- Compatible with Microsoft Azure platform

### Requirements

- An ASP.net web server (supporting .NET 4.5+)
- A small database deployed with the web site (Default is using LocalDb. Note: that LocalDb is not working on Azure and you need to provide your own connection string during SharpCLABot setup) 

## What is a CLA?

> The purpose of a CLA is to ensure that the guardian of a project's outputs has the necessary ownership or grants of rights over all contributions to allow them to distribute under the chosen licence.
> [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)

## How is it working?

### A new contributor... 
A new contributor is opening a pull-request on your repository that is being watched by SharpCLABot:

> ![PullRequest1](images/Workflow-PullRequest-1.png)

### SharpCLABot replies...
SharpCLABot is replying that this contributor has not yet signed the CLA for the project, and invite the contributor to sign it:

> ![PullRequest2](images/Workflow-PullRequest-2.png)

### The contributor signs...
The contributor go to the signing website provided by SharpCLABot and fill-out the form to sign the CLA:

> ![PullRequest3](images/Workflow-PullRequest-3.png)
> 
> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> 
> ![PullRequest4](images/Workflow-PullRequest-4.png)

### The contributor has signed...
The contributor has just signed the CLA and is redirected to its pull request with a comment acknowledge from SharpCLABot:

> ![PullRequest5](images/Workflow-PullRequest-5.png)
